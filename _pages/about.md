Hello! Welcome to my homepage! I'm a master's student at [New York University (NYU)](https://www.nyu.edu/), majoring [Computer Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering). Before that, I earned my B.Eng of Data Science in the [School of Data Science and Engineering(DaSE)](https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/) with distinction at [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/).

Currently, I am working at NLP group of [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) as a research intern under the supervision of Dr. Fei Yuan, focusing on topics of multimodal/multilingual LLMs. Prior to this, I worked as a research assistant in the Statistics Lab of DaSE under the supervision of Dr. Lyu Ni.
